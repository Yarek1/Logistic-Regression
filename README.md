# Logistic-Regression
This project is about logistic regression with prime number classification using MNIST handwritten dataset.
We use Logistic Regression to predict digit labels based on images. 
The image above shows a bunch of training digits (observations) from the MNIST dataset whose category membership is known (labels 0–9). 
After training a model with logistic regression, it can be used to predict an image label (labels 0–9) given an image.

The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. 
It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data 
while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.
